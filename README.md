# LLD - Low-Level Design Practice Repository

Welcome to the Low-Level Design (LLD) practice repository! This repository contains a collection of system design problems, solutions, and patterns focused on low-level design principles.

## ðŸ“š What is Low-Level Design?

Low-Level Design (LLD) focuses on the detailed design of individual components and modules of a system. It involves creating class diagrams, implementing design patterns, applying SOLID principles, and making code-level architecture decisions. This repository serves as a hands-on resource for practicing LLD problems commonly asked in technical interviews and building well-designed software systems.
